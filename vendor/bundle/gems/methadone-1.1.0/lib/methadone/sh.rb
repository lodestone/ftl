module Methadone
  # Module with various helper methods for executing external commands.
  # In most cases, you can use #sh to run commands and have decent logging
  # done.  You will likely use this in a class that also mixes-in
  # Methadone::CLILogging (remembering that Methadone::Main mixes this in for you).  
  # If you <b>don't</b>, you must provide a logger via #set_sh_logger.
  #
  # == Examples
  #
  #    include Methadone::SH
  #
  #    sh 'cp foo.txt /tmp'
  #    # => logs the command to DEBUG, executes the command, logs its output to DEBUG and its
  #    #    error output to WARN, returns 0
  # 
  #    sh 'cp non_existent_file.txt /nowhere_good'
  #    # => logs the command to DEBUG, executes the command, logs its output to INFO and
  #    #    its error output to WARN, returns the nonzero exit status of the underlying command
  # 
  #    sh! 'cp non_existent_file.txt /nowhere_good'
  #    # => same as above, EXCEPT, raises a Methadone::FailedCommandError
  #
  #    sh 'cp foo.txt /tmp' do
  #      # Behaves exactly as before, but this block is called after
  #    end
  #
  #    sh 'cp non_existent_file.txt /nowhere_good' do
  #      # This block isn't called, since the command failed
  #    end
  #
  #    sh 'ls -l /tmp/' do |stdout|
  #      # stdout contains the output of the command
  #    end
  #    sh 'ls -l /tmp/ /non_existent_dir' do |stdout,stderr|
  #      # stdout contains the output of the command,
  #      # stderr contains the standard error output.
  #     end
  #    
  # == Handling process execution
  #
  # In order to work on as many Rubies as possible, this class defers the actual execution
  # to an execution strategy.  See #set_execution_strategy if you think you'd like to override
  # that, or just want to know how it works.
  #
  # == More complex execution and subprocess management
  #
  # This is not intended to be a complete replacement for Open3 or an enhanced means of managing subprocesses.
  # This is to make it easy for you to shell-out to external commands and have your app be robust and
  # easy to maintain.
  module SH
    def self.included(k)
      k.extend(self)
    end
    # Run a shell command, capturing and logging its output.
    # If the command completed successfully, it's output is logged at DEBUG.
    # If not, its output as logged at INFO.  In either case, its
    # error output is logged at WARN.
    #
    # command:: the command to run
    # options:: options to control the call. Currently responds to:
    #           +:expected+:: an Int or Array of Int representing error codes, <b>in addition to 0</b>, that are
    #                         expected and therefore constitute success.  Useful for commands that don't use
    #                         exit codes the way you'd like
    # block:: if provided, will be called if the command exited nonzero.  The block may take 0, 1, 2, or 3 arguments.
    #         The arguments provided are the standard output as a string, standard error as a string, and
    #         the exitstatus as an Int.
    #         You should be safe to pass in a lambda instead of a block, as long as your
    #         lambda doesn't take more than three arguments
    #
    # Example
    #
    #     sh "cp foo /tmp"
    #     sh "ls /tmp" do |stdout|
    #       # stdout contains the output of ls /tmp
    #     end
    #     sh "ls -l /tmp foobar" do |stdout,stderr|
    #       # ...
    #     end
    #
    # Returns the exit status of the command.  Note that if the command doesn't exist, this returns 127.

    #           <tt>:expected</tt>:: same as for #sh
    #           <tt>:on_fail</tt>:: a custom error message.  This allows you to have your

    #                               message that they see.
    #
    # Raises Methadone::FailedCommandError if the command exited nonzero.

    #     sh!("rsync foo bar", :on_fail => "Couldn't rsync, check log for details")
